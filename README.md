# Remote Elevator Control System

This project involves controlling a physical elevator remotely through a website GUI.

The elevator system uses a CAN network, where each floor (plus the elevator car) is a different node.

The node information is saved in a MySQL database.

XAMPP server is used running on a Linux system to implement host/server communication to a remote computer.

The remote website GUI was designed and implemented using HTML, CSS (+ Bootstrap), Javascript, PHP, and C/C++.
