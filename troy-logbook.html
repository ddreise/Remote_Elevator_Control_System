		<b>
		<h>May 19th, 2020</h>
		<hr/>
		</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Joined up with Justin T., Dan, and Brandon for projects this term</li>
			<li>First team meeting to discuss meeting schedule and review the charter. We'll be hosting meetings every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, schedule permitting.</li>
			<li>I proposed Azure DevOps as our version control interface. The team requested a quick demo for tomorrow's meeting.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<b>
		<h>May 20th, 2020</h>
		<hr/>
		</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Team meeting today. I briefly demo'd Azure DevOps and the team came to a consensus to make use of the software for the term project.</li>
			<li>We discussed the project plan. I've been assigned to creating the plan for phase 3 and entering that into DevOps</li>
		</ul>

		<b>
		<h>May 21st, 2020</h>
		<hr/>
		</b>
		<ul>
			<li>A brief team discussion in the group chat lead to further project planning.</li>
			<li>Brandon and I will head the hardware team for this phase and implement the loopback setup of the CAN on our F303 boards.</li>
			<li>Dan and Justin will work together on the website and establish the gantt chart.</li>
			<li>Tomorrow morning I intend on finishing the plan for phase 3, and in the afternoon, Brandon and I will begin on the CAN implementation.</li>
		</ul>

		<b>
		<h>May 22nd, 2020</h>
		<hr/>
		</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Created and updated log book.</li>
			<li>Created and comitted project plan for phase 3.</li>
			<li>Sent my capstone idea to Alex for consideration before preparing my formal proposal to the capstone team.</li>
			<li>Brandon and I worked on the CAN bus base code to get loopback mode working. We got to a point where we could see a message be transmitted on one end and received on another.</li>
			<li>I created and filled in the test information for the CAN bus bring-up. Brandon agreed to finish testing later tonight, and we will review tomorrow.</li>
		</ul>

		<h id="week2">Week 2</h><br/>
		<b>
		<h>May 25th, 2020</h>
		<hr/>
		</b>
		<ul>
			<li>The team had it's first debrief. Ali and Michael were pleased with our overall progress, and only requested that we complete the project plan for the rest of the project and update our CAN protocol to listen to filters</li>
			<li>After debrief, the team got together to fill out the rest of the project plan. For this week, I'll be working on a floor selection system for the webpage.</li>
			<li>The team decided that working in Azure DevOps was too much additional overhead and was causing enough confusion to remove it from the project infrastructure.</li>
		</ul>
		<b>
		<h>May 27th, 2020</h>
		<hr/>
		</b>
		<ul>
			<li>I worked on the floor selection page today. So far, I've simply created a separate page with radio buttons for selecting the floors. I imagine I'll be able to do more once we know a bit more about the backend</li>
		</ul>
		<b>
			<h>May 28th, 2020</h>
			<hr/>
		</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Worked on filter code. Managed to figure out how to set the filter ID and masking bits</li>
			<li>Setting a new ID allows me to filter out messages for the receiver. The mask would allow me to set different bits to define a range of IDs that would be considered valid.</li>
			<li>I can't seem to figure out how to change the transmission ID for the messages, but I can filter messages for the receiver. I'll have to uplink with Brandon this weekend to try to figure the rest of this out.</li>
		</ul>
		<b>
			<h>June 1st, 2020</h>
			<hr/>
		</b>
		<ul>
			<li>I completely misintepreted the requirements from last week, and as a result, I'm behind on my tasks for the project. <br/>I figured I was working on a very basic page for the call stations, but what I was actually assigned to was the floor selection that would be within the elevator car.</li>
			<li>I'll try to create a new page that would simulate being inside of an elevator car.</li>
			<li>I also learned from today's debriefing that the ID for messages is a definition at the top of the source code. I can change this value to change the ID of messages that will interact with the filters.</li>
			<li>Just below the filter initialization is the TxHeader section, which is where we set up the frame for the CAN message and where the ID value is used.</li>
